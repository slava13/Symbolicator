# Symbolicator

This is a standalone app that allows you to symbolicate crash and sample from your application. The rules are simple: if file has .txt extension - sample symbolication logic works, if file has .crash extension - crash symbolication logic works. By default - output (symbolicated) file will be saved on ~/Desktop
